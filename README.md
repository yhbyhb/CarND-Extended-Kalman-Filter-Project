[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This is my work for project of Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program of Udacity.

Build instruction and dependency of this project is identical to [upstream repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) which is the starter code repository of udacity.

### Result
Here is my RMSE result and it satisfies accuracy criteria of [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/748/view). `RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52]`
